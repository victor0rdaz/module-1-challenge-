  Alternative Financing
 
Overview and origin 

The  name of the company I will be researching is Paypal 
Paypal was founded and incorporated in December 1998
The founders of PayPal are  Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek 
The idea to create PayPal came after the trio established a company called Confinity which created security software for smaller devices, unfortunately this idea didn’t have much success which led to them switching their focus over to a digital wallet which then merged with Elon Musks X.com, and that’s how PayPal came about.
Paypal is funded through individual consumers like you and me by sending money which they then collect a small amount through a service fee. They also gain revenue through partnerships with merchants, where their form of payment will be pushed as a primary form of payment .


Business Activities
With the invention of PayPal, PayPal is trying to solve the lack of access to loans for those without banks nearby. They also provide an alternative to online money transfers as you won’t have to write a check or get a money order to be able to send money
Paypal’s targeted audience would be people who regularly conduct online transfers such as online shopping or international shopping. As well as people who do not have time to go to a bank and go through the process, as they can do it all through their phone. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any information on the market size for this set of customers 
Something Paypal offers that most of its competitors can’t offer at the level they do is their security and fraud prevention as they encrypt any information you input keeping it safe. They also offer to get your money back if you don’t receive your goods or your purchase ends up being fraudulent 
One of the technologies PayPal uses that sets it apart from the competition and makes it the best in its field, is its digital layer which makes it easier to transfer and clear money between accounts seamlessly.

	Landscape
Paypal falls under the alternative financing domain as it can provide financing in many ways and all over the world
One major trend in the past 5-10 years of alternative financing would be an advancement in security and fraud prevention, instant transfers, and financing becoming widely available, especially to those in remote areas 
Other major companies would affirm, klarna, zip, and Apple Pay Later just to name a few

	Results
The business impact of PayPal has been very positive as many merchants have reported an increase in customer satisfaction as processing transactions have gotten easier as well as having the ability to get a loan to purchase products
 Some core metrics used in this domain are customer satisfaction, transaction speed, security, and fraud prevention. Paypal is doing pretty well by these metrics as they are one of the biggest companies and they have many partnerships with merchants which indicates it’s widely trusted.
Paypal is one of the biggest if not the biggest companies in alternative financing as they provide many ways to gain financing with very little information and also with how user-friendly their interface 

		Recommendations
I would suggest PayPal tap into the gaming world and offer its services to Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo as a payment option for in-game options or even the ability to finance a console
This would benefit PayPal as they will be introducing their product to the gaming world which continues to grow every year this will make them ungodly amounts of money by making it easier to make in-game purchases with PayPal rather than having to insert your card manually, and they will also open the door to many people who can’t afford the consoles outright and now will have the option to finance 
This service will utilize the same technology used already as they have partnered before with merchants the only difference is it will be available on consoles
